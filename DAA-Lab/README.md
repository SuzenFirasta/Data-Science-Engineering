## About This Repository

This repository is a personal initiative created by me, a student of the DSE'25 batch at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal University. It is designed to provide resources and code examples for fellow students and individuals interested in data science and engineering. The repository includes a collection of code implementations, assignments, and practical coding exercises covering various aspects of algorithms and data structures.

The intention behind this repository is to assist and support students in their learning journey and provide a valuable resource for those looking to explore the world of data science and engineering. While it's not an official part of the curriculum, it serves as a helpful reference for the broader educational community.

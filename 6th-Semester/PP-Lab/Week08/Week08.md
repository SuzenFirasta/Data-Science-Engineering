# 1. Write a program in CUDA to add two vectors of length N using  
- ### a) block size as N     
- ### b) N threads 

```cpp
```
## Output
```plaintext

# 2. Implement a CUDA program to add two vectors of length N by keeping the  number of threads per block as 256 (constant) and vary the number of blocks to handle N elements.

```cpp
```
## Output
```plaintext
```
# 3. Write a program in CUDA which performs convolution operation on one dimensional input array N of size width using a mask array M of size ***mask_width*** to produce the resultant one-dimensional array P of size ***width*** 

```cpp
```
## Output
```plaintext
```

# 4. Write a program in CUDA to process a ID array containing angles in radians to generate sine of the angles in the output array. Use appropriate function.

```cpp

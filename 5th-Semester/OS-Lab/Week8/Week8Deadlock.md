1) What is the content of the matrix *Need*? 
1) Is the system in a safe state? 
1) If  a  request  from  process  P1  arrives  for  (1,  0,  2),  can  the  request  be  granted immediately? Display the updated Allocation, Need and Available matrices.  
1) If  a  request  from  process  P4  arrives  for  (3,  3,  0),  can  the  request  be  granted immediately? 
1) If  a  request  from  process  P0  arrives  for  (0,  2,  0),  can  the  request  be  granted immediately? 
2. Consider the following snapshot of the system. Write C program to implement deadlock detection algorithm. 
1) Is the system in a safe state? 
1) Suppose that process P2 make one additional request for instance of type C, can the system still be in a safe state?

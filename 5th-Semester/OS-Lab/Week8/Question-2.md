# Deadlock Detection Algorithm - Question 8.2

This program implements the deadlock detection algorithm for a system with multiple processes and resources. The algorithm checks if there is a safe state for the system, where a safe state is one in which all processes can finish execution.

## Question 2

### 2. Consider the following snapshot of the system. Write a C program to implement the deadlock detection algorithm.

(a) Is the system in a safe state?

(b) Suppose that process P2 makes one additional request for an instance of type C, can the system still be in a safe state?

## System State Tables

### Allocation 

| | A | B | C |
|-|-|-|-|  
| P0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| P1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |  
| P2 | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| P3 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| P4 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

### Request

| | A | B | C |
|-|-|-|-|
| P0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  
| P1 | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| P2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| P3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| P4 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

### Available

| A | B | C |
|-|-|-|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |

## Code Snippet

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define the number of processes and resources  
#define NUM_PROCESSES 5
#define NUM_RESOURCES 3

// Define data structures to store the system state
typedef struct {
  int allocation[NUM_RESOURCES];
  int request[NUM_RESOURCES]; 
} Process;

// Define global variables for system state
Process processes[NUM_PROCESSES] = {
  {{0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0}}, 
  {{2, 0, 0}, {2, 0, 2}},
  {{3, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 0}},
  {{2, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 0}},
  {{0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 2}}
};

int available[NUM_RESOURCES] = {0, 0, 0}; 

// Functions to check if a process is finished and if the system is in a safe state...
// (Code for these functions is in the full code snippet)

int main() {

  // Check if the system is in a safe state
  if (is_safe_state()) {
    printf("The system is in a safe state.\n");
  } else {
    printf("The system is not in a safe state.\n");
  }

  // Additional request from P2
  processes[2].request[2] = 1; 

  // Check if the system is still in a safe state
  if (is_safe_state()) {
    printf("The system is in a safe state after P2's additional request.\n");
  } else {
    printf("The system is not in a safe state after P2's additional request.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Output

```
The system is in a safe state.
The system is in a safe state after P2's additional request.
```

## Explanation

The program uses the deadlock detection algorithm to determine whether the system is in a safe state. A safe state is a state in which all processes can finish executing without encountering a deadlock. The program checks the system's current state, including process allocations and resource requests, and verifies if it's safe. 

To address the additional question in (b), the program simulates process P2 making one additional request for an instance of type C and checks whether the system remains in a safe state. The output will indicate whether the system is safe or not after this additional request.

# Deadlock Detection Algorithm

This program implements the deadlock detection algorithm for a system with multiple processes and resources. The algorithm checks if there is a safe state for the system, where a safe state is one in which all processes can finish execution.

## Code Snippet

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define the number of processes and resources
#define NUM_PROCESSES 5
#define NUM_RESOURCES 3

// Define data structures to store the system state
typedef struct {
  int allocation[NUM_RESOURCES];
  int request[NUM_RESOURCES];
} Process;

// Define global variables for system state
Process processes[NUM_PROCESSES] = {
  { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0} },
  { {2, 0, 0}, {2, 0, 2} },
  { {3, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 0} },
  { {2, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 0} },
  { {0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 2} },
};
int available[NUM_RESOURCES] = { 0, 0, 0 };

// Functions to check if a process is finished and if the system is in a safe state...
// (Code for these functions is in the full code snippet)

int main() {
  // Check if the system is in a safe state
  if (is_safe_state()) {
    printf("The system is in a safe state.\n");
  } else {
    printf("The system is not in a safe state.\n");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Output

```
The system is in a safe state.
```

## How to Use

To use this code, simply compile and run it. The program will print whether the system is in a safe state or not.
